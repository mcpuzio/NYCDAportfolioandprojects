				A gazelle is any of many antelope species in the genus Gazella or formerly considered to belong to it. The name gazelle comes from Arabic name غزال ġazāl. Six species are included in two genera, Eudorcas and Nanger, which were formerly considered subgenera. The genus Procapra has also been considered a subgenus of Gazella, and its members are also referred to as gazelles, though they are not dealt with in this article.
